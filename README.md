# MyCross

MyCross (temporary name) is a crossfit app where people can create a profile and use it as 
* Owner of a training center
* Athlete of a training center

The main goal of this app is having an easy way to pay your training center and book your vacancy in the time you want to check in.

This backend is still under construction, and I am using Nodejs, MikroORM, Apollo, GraphQL, Postgres and Redis to build it.

Feel free to fork this project if you want :)
